      We think that organizations working for Open should be sure that they're being open themselves--with their code
      and data, and with the details of their operation. We're doing our best to live up to that, and this page
      is part of that effort. If you've got feedback, <a href="mailto:team@ourresearch.org">drop us a line!</a>

      All monetary figures are in US dollars.

    <div class="text-h4" id="grants">Grants</div>
    <p>
      We publish all our grant proposals, both the successful ones and the ones that don't get funded. We also publish
      annual and final grant reports. These are all posted on
      <a href="https://www.ogrants.org">Open Grants</a> (search for "Piwowar" or "Priem" to find them). As of May 2021,
      we've submitted 12 grant proposals, or about one a year on average.
    </p>


    <div class="text-h4" id="salaries">Salaries</div>
    <p>Our board members are unpaid volunteers, except for Heather and Jason, who are on the board but are paid (in
      their capacity of co-CEOs).</p>
    <p>
      Our executives (Heather Piwowar and Jason Priem) share the role of co-CEO, as well as both serving as senior
      software developers. Their annual salaries are equal, and have varied substantially over the years, from a low of
      $25,000 to a high of $175,000. This latter figure is their current salary. Historical salaries for Jason, Heather,
      and any other employees can be found in our tax records (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      For hourly workers (including workers on cloud platforms like <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk">Mechanical Turk</a>), we pay a minimum wage of
      $25/hour.
    </p>


    <div class="text-h4" id="taxes">Tax filings</div>
    <p>
      As a 501(c)3, we're exempt from corporate taxes. However, the law does require that we file a Form 990 to the IRS
      every year. This is great, because you can look up any 501(c)3 nonprofit's Form 990 and learn lots about their
      finances. You can find our annual Form 990 filings in many places online; <a
        href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/461599252">here are all our 990 filings</a> in
      Nonprofit Explorer by Pro Publica, for example. If you search for our taxes on other sites, you'll probably want
      to search under "Impactstory;" we
      <a href="https://blog.ourresearch.org/our-research/">changed our name</a> to OurResearch in 2019, but that's a <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_name">DBA</a>--we're still Impactstory to the government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our most recent 990 filing (fiscal year 2020) is not public yet, but you can <a href="/IRS-form-990-2020.pdf"

    <div class="text-h4" id="posi">Principles for Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</div>
    <blockquote>
      <div>
        "First developed in a <a href="https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/">2015
        blog post,</a> POSI offers a set of guidelines by which open scholarly infrastructure organisations and
        initiatives that support the research community can be run and sustained."
      </div>
      <div>
        <em>
          source: <a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/about/">POSI website</a>
        </em>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When we read the <a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/">sixteen POSI principles</a>, we saw right away
      that they were solidly aligned with our core values of openness, progress, pragmatism, sustainability, and
      community. We're delighted to see momentum building around these kinds of values, and so we were thrilled to make
      OurResearch the fifth organization to commit to the POSI principles. We encourage other scholarly communications
      to do this as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full description of the principles and how we're honoring them is pretty long, so it's outside the scope of
      this page. You can read
      <a href="https://blog.ourresearch.org/posi/">Our POSI commitment here.</a>
    </p>

    <div class="text-h4" id="code">Code</div>
    <p>
      The first lines of code we ever wrote together, at an all-night hackathon in 2011, were open-source. And as
      die-hard open-source advocates, that's still our approach. All our projects are open-source from day one, even
      before they're released.
    </p>
    <p>


      We license code under the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT License.</a> The MIT license is a "permissive license,"
      meaning it imposes very few restrictions on downstream use. We're happy that our code has often been reused and
      repurposed, by both nonprofit and for-profit organizations. You can find the code for all our projects on <a
        href="htthttps://github.com/ourresearch">GitHub.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If OurResearch or GitHub were to become sufficiently evil, this GitHub-hosted code could be removed or
      re-licensed. So it's important that our code is also held in the
      <a href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/search/?q=ourresearch&with_visit=true&with_content=true">Software
        Heritage archive,</a> maintained outside our control a by third-party nonprofit dedicated to the long-term
      preservation of its openness.
    </p>


    <div class="text-h4" id="papers">Research papers</div>
    <p>
      Heather and Jason were both academic researchers before moving to OurResearch full-time, and we still publish
      research papers. Naturally, we publish only Open Access (OA) papers. We've occasionally published in toll-access
      journals, but in these cases we've either convinced the publishers to make our articles OA, or taken the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access#Green_OA">green OA road</a> by self-archiving the papers in a
      repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we publish papers, Heather and Jason always both listed as co-authors, and we determine our author order with
      a coin flip (for the curious: heads=Heather, tails=Jason 😁). You can see a list of our papers on ORCID (<a
        href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6187-6610">Jason,</a> <a
        href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1613-5981">Heather</a>) or Google Scholar (<a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w32jC0YAAAAJ&hl=en">Jason,</a> <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1YLq0XMAAAAJ&hl=en">Heather</a>); lamentably, the Google ones
      are more complete.
    </p>


    <div class="text-h4" id="data">Data</div>
    <p>
      We make the data behind our projects open. For example, you can download a full dump of the <a
        href="https://unpaywall.org">Unpaywall</a> database, all 120M+ rows of it, any time. That data is also available
      via a public, open API with generous rate limits (100,000 calls per day). More specific details on data dumps and
      APIs are available on individual project pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of our data consists of "facts" that have no copyright (see <a
        href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossrefs-board-votes-to-adopt-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/">this
      Crossref blog post</a> for more discussion of this). We can't apply a license to these (nor, appealingly, can
      anyone else). Where copyright is applicable, though, our data is
      <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">CC0, "no rights reserved."</a>

    <div class="text-h4" id="corporate">Corporate documents</div>
    <p>
      We incorporated in North Carolina (USA) in 2012. Here are our <a href="/articles-of-incorporation.pdf">Articles of
      Incorporation</a> and our corporate <a href="/bylaws.pdf">by-laws.</a> Our IRS EIN (Employer Identification
      Number) is 46-1599252; here's our <a href="/IRS-w-9.pdf">IRS form W-9</a> which is pretty much just a fancy way of
      sharing that number. We've also got a <a href="/canada-business-registration.pdf">Canadian business number.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      To become a US 501(c)3, we submitted this <a href="/IRS-1023.pdf">Form 1023</a> to the IRS, describing why we
      think we met the criteria for this type of nonprofit. The IRS thought about it for a while, and then issued us
      this <a href="/IRS-determination.pdf">determination letter,</a> granting us 501(c)3 status.
