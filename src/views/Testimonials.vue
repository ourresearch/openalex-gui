OpenAlex provided us with a single consistent dataset of publications, allowing us to look at researchers by subject area and institution. From their publication history, we could look at peoples careers, how they had moved between New Zealand and other countries, how they had moved between institutions, and how long they had remained actively publishing.<br><br>

The OpenAlex dataset was a game changer for us. As we are informing public policy, using an open dataset that allows for transparency is essential. We are planning to release a small dataset, derived from OpenAlex, that is of New Zealand researchers only. This will be widely accessible. This kind of repurposing would not be possible without the open licensing provided by OpenAlex`,

Before OpenAlex, we faced challenges in listing publications affiliated with the given institutions; furthermore, we had no citation information for institution-affiliated publications, except for data provided by OpenCitations. Additionally, there was no discipline-specific data available for these institution-affiliated publications. We attempted to collect affiliation data from our various data sources including CrossRef, but none of these yielded satisfactory results. <br><br>

OpenAlex sovled this by providing publication information, citation data, and discipline-specific insights for institution-affiliated publications. This support proved to be invaluable for our operations. OpenAlex provides accurate affiliation data, effortlessly and quickly; this has been a great advantage for us. Furthermore, OpenAlex’s daily updates ensure our clients always have access to the most current information. <br><br>

We are impressed with OpenAlex's ability to establish relationships between various data points: it connects publications with authors, institutions with authors, and publications with disciplines. I would definitely recommend OpenAlex to others. In my opinion, OpenAlex has the potential to become an essential service used globally. To be honest, we are heavily reliant on SciVal and InCites for institutional statistics. Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) companies are quite strict with their data due to this dependence. I see OpenAlex as an important initiative that could eventually replace these products...I believe OpenAlex holds great promise for the future.`,

Although there are other options available for academic or corporate researchers who can afford costly subscription services, a service like OpenAlex levels the playing field and makes data equally accessible to researchers. This may help researchers have a common source of information for comparison, instead of trying to compare data from one paid service to another.<br><br>

I was using MAG before it was discontinued and had to download the entire dataset on my local computer. It took me a few months to set up MAG to run simple queries. OpenAlex API has vastly improved my workflow and has (almost) eliminated any setup costs. <br><br>

In my current project, OpenAlex author disambiguation and affiliation data havs been helpful in identifying the sources of scientific knowledge and in matching the information to media data. <br><br>

I have recommended OpenAlex to many colleagues.`,

Previously (and currently) I use expensive proprietary data sources for my research, but I am currently moving all of my projects to use OpenAlex. Not only is OpenAlex more affordable, but it provides more convenient access (well structured data downloads and an extremely well designed API), and I have found the data to be often of higher quality. In particular, OpenAlex has among the best available data on disambiguated authorship and author metadata that I have encountered. It also offers up-to-date data from a variety of sources, without undue focus on only, e.g., books or journals.<br><br>

As one example, an ongoing project requires both bibliometric data and full text of published articles. OpenAlex makes it extremely easy to find high-quality versions of open-access publications that can be processed programmatically. There is no better solution for this kind of project that I know of.<br><br>

I would, and often do, recommend OpenAlex to others who need this kind of data.`,

My challenges are three-fold. First, I need the dataset that best identifies and matches scientists by name. OpenAlex has made the biggest effort at disambiguation of scientists. Second, I needed a dataset that allowed me to collect a very specific set of variables. OpenAlex's API makes this incredibly easy, and I can assemble exactly the dataset I need. Third, I was looking for detailed geo-location data for every institution in my dataset. OpenAlex can provide me with latitudinal and longitudinal details, which is perfect for my needs. Lastly, it is a huge plus that I can access OpenAlex with a Python script!<br><br>

I used CADRE's Web of Science dataset which was less transparent in terms of data coverage and quality and did not offer me a solution to the challenges I faced. There was also essentially no customer service to provide me with information or possible solutions to my questions or concerns.<br><br>

I have found OpenAlex’s data quality to be excellent.  In addition, the continuous push for improvement is a big benefit versus other data providers. This is a huge consideration for researchers overall (increasingly so). Their documentation expressed efforts and transparency which gives me more confidence in my data quality (or at least allows me and potential readers of my research to evaluate the quality).  The easy to use API makes accessing the data much simpler versus other sources like CADRE.
OpenAlex has enabled me to build a cleanly assembled dataset of publications by my set of scientists of interest with minimal effort and maximum confidence in data quality.<br><br>

OpenAlex has the better, more performant API with higher call rates. Information about OpenAccess copies is very reliable.   In addition, the quality of the metadata is excellent. The data structure uses identifiers, to make lateral searching very easy.  Overall, the amazing data quality, breadth and depth of coverage and the good support make a difference.  OpenAlex is also very well documented.  <br><br>

<li>Try to locate the paper in a variety of repositories (CrossRef, ArXiv, bioRxiv ...) and retrieve metadata from there, including the DOI.</li>
<li>If there is a DOI, look it up in Unpaywall to see if there is an open-access version of the paper.</li>

Now, using OpenAlex, we can do this in a single step, retrieving both metadata and the 'best' location of the paper. This is much faster - often by several seconds per article.
